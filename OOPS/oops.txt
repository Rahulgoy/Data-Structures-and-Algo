Why we need OOPS?
Why? Because if you stick to the rules, it makes complex code easier to develop, more relieable, more maintainable, and generally better.

Because OOP insists that you think about what you expose to the outside world, it lets you change the implementation of an object without affecting any other code. (Encapsulation)
Because it allows you to have many different functions, all with the same name, all doing the same job, but on different data. (Polymorphism)
Because it lets you write a set of functions, then expand them in different direction without changing or copying them in any way. (Inheritance)
